# seat arrangement uses binary space partitioning where
# F is front, B is back, L is left, and R is right
# first 7 chars are either F or B which specify which row (0-127)
# each letter states which half of a region the given seat is in
# last 3 chars are either L or R which specify which column (0-7)
# with the same process being used
# each seat has a unique id: multiply row by 8, add column

# eg. FBFBBFFRLR states:
# F (0-63)
# B (32-63)
# F (32-47)
# B (40-47)
# B (44-47)
# F (44-45)
# F (44) -> seat at row 44
# R (4-7)
# L (4-5)
# R(5) -> seat at column 5
# thus FBFBBFFRLR is a seat at row 44, column 5 with unique id 357

# part 1
# what is the highest seat id on a boarding pass

# part 2
# It's a completely full flight, so your seat should be the
# only missing boarding pass in your list. However, there's a catch:
# some of the seats at the very front and back of the plane don't
# exist on this aircraft, so they'll be missing from your list as well.
